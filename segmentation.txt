segmentation was introduced on the intel 8086 as a way to allow programs to address more than 64KB of memory, and this version is real mode.

The intel 80286 introducted a second version of segmentation, that added support for _virtual memory_ and _memory protection_, and this was named protected mode.

In both read and protected modes, the system use 16-bit segment registers to obtain the actual memory address.

Read mode,
CS: code segment
DS: data segment
SS: stack segemnt
ES: programmer use

The intel 80386 introduced _paging_ unit, and added two more segment registers, FS and GS

x86-64 architecture force CS, SS, DS, ES to zero, and FS, GS can be used.
